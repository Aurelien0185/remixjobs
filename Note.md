Coding Notes
------
##### `Node.js`
		1. More understand what exports means in module:
			exports(for example: exports.xxx) is a REFERENCE to the value of MODULE.EXPORTS</b>
			REAL exporting is MODULE.EXPORTS(if they have different values)
		2. Use keyword CONST and LET instead of var to find the bugs easier.
		3. Use Function_Name.PROTOTYPE.member_Name to make this member becomes PRIVATE.
		4. continue///

##### `Mongodb`
		1. Mongoose
