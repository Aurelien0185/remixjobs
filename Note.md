Coding Notes
------
* Node.js
  * More understand what exports means in module:</br>
	=> exports(for example: exports.xxx) is a <b> reference </b> to the value of <b>module.exports</b></br>
	=> real exporting is <b>module.exports</b> (if they have different values)
  * Using const and let instead of var to find the bugs easier. </br>
  * Function_Name.<b>prototype</b>.member_Name:
  => this member is <b>private</b>
  * continue///

* Mongodb
